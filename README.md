# DNS-of-TBLs-at-ReTau180
Direct numerical simulation of turbulent boundary layers at ReTau180 via Nek5000

The mesh contains 100 million elements.
The periodic boundary conditions were used.
The domain size is 8pi x 2 x 3pi.
The elements: Nx Ny Nz = 1024 192 512.
The result at t = 360 s or t^+ = 23 was shown in the .dat files.
